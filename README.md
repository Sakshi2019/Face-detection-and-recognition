# Face-detection-and-recognition
In this project we are presenting a method to detect and identify the human faces and developing a system which recognizes a face of a person from the given trained dataset. Our methodology of recognition system is based on the two dimensional face extraction. Eigenface approach is used to identify a face. Eigenvectors of the civariance matrix are obtained corresponding to the highest 30 eigenvalues and projected on a face space. These projected vectors are called as Eigenface which need not to resemble the exact face features, for e.g., eyes, nose, ears, etc. 
This system provides the capabilty to recognize the new faces in unsupervised manner and can be applicable in many real life problems.
